# Buy4Me :cloud:

Buy4Me is an Airfrov-inspired app.
It is an app where you can post your favourite request (anything under the sky) and someone will get it for you.

## Using the app

1. Each player is given a set of 5 dices with cups used for concealment.
2. At the beginning of each round, each player will shuffle their dices and looks at their dices while keeping it concealed from other players.
3. A player(P1) will begin bidding, annoucing the face value with the minimum number of dice(s) that the player believes are under all of the cups in the game.
4. On the next player's(P2) turn, he/she will have 2 choices:
   a. make a higher bid - increasing either the quantity of the face value or the number of dices or both
   b. challenge P1's bid - essentially calling P1 a liar
5. Once a bid is challenged, all the dices are revealed.
6. If the bid is at least as many of the face value as it is called, the bidder (P1) wins otherwise, P2 wins.

## Tech used

MEN stack:
-> MongoDB — document database
-> Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
-> Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server

## Technical details

Learn more about functions, DOM manipulation, OOP just to name a few!

## Technical challenges

Every step of the project was a challenge. From creating the players to incorporating the logic within the game.

## One new thing learnt

Every step of the project was a challenge. From creating the players to incorporating the logic within the game.

## Improvements I might make

1. Add the theme song of POC as audio
2. Make it responsive
3. Change the dice colour to show matching dice faces when liar is being called (for easier visual)
