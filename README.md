# Buy4Me :cloud:

Buy4Me is an Airfrov-inspired app.
It is an app where you can request for anything under the sky and another user will connect with you and get it for you.

## App link

-   https://buy4me-h.herokuapp.com/

## User Story

1. When the user first goes to the app -> sees at an instant all of the items requested by different users.
2. He can sign up for an account and then log in.
3. Once logged in, he can create/edit/delete request made by him.
4. He can also contact and connect with a user should he choose to help a user to fulfil their request.

## Tech used

MEEN stack:
-> MongoDB — document database
-> Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
-> EJS - Embedded JavaScript
-> Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server

## Technical details

User:

-   sign up through a form
-   log in through a form -> user is authenticated upon signing in, password is hashed.
-   create a request using a form
-   can only edit/delete request of user's own post
-   can contact other user's via their post

## Technical challenges

-   difficulty linking 2 schemas together
-   understanding the code -> console log everything!

## One new thing learnt

Always ask and reach out for help!

## Improvements I might make

1. Add the function of search where it will filter out the items based on the country specified
2. Have a map to indicate the item request location
3. Create a chat between users
